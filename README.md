# Flexbox

## Introduction

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AltCampus/flexbox/master/media/banner.png)

I hope we all have the basic knowledge of HTML and CSS now. In the last few days, we have learned how to position an element in a page according to the layout. We have learned about the floats and inline-block as well as a few advanced properties to position the elements. I am sure you all have been through the pains while working with the floats and a few other properties of positioning. Because I also have been the same problem as you guys are facing now.

We always had been doing all those hackish methods of floats, table displays, inline-block for positioning the elements. But we can ditch all the hacky methods now. We are ready to go with flexbox. Flexbox is one of the most interesting topics of CSS. I am sure while working flexbox you will enjoy and will have a lot of fun.

## Topics of the day

1. What is flexbox?
2. How does the flexbox model work?
3. Flex Wrap
4. Flex ordering
5. Flexbox Alignment

- Justify Content

- Align Content
- Align Self

6. Flex Sizing with flex Property

## 1. What is flexbox?

Flexbox provides us a more efficient way to layout elements. It gives us the ability to align the items and distribute space among the items in a container - even though the size of the elements are unknown or dynamic. With the flexbox we get the power of flexibility(as the word flex says) in order fill the available space. So that elements can easily accommodate according to the size of screens. In a flexbox container, item expands to fill the free space as well as shrinks to prevent overflow.

## 2. How does the flexbox model work?

Flexbox model comes with some sets of properties and values. In that few properties can be applied to parent container and few can be applied only on children items. So to make use of those flexbox model properties and values we will have to go into the zone of flexbox. So how do we go into that?

To do so, we start with `display: flex` property and value. We set the parent's styles as `display: flex`. Once we do so we are in the zone of the flexbox model. Now we can get benefitted with the properties of the flexbox model. Without setting the parent element's style as `display: flex`, we cannot make use of any property related to the flexbox model.

So what happens we set the parent's style as `display: flex`. Let's check it out:

```
  <div class="container">
    <div class="item">1</div>
    <div class="item">2</div>
    <div class="item">3</div>
  </div>

  * {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
  }
  .container {
    display: flex;
    background: #FAFFFC;
    border: 5px solid #182945;
  }
  .item {
    background: #9EDDEB;
    padding: 40px 50px;
    font-size: 34px;
    margin: 10px;
  }

```

This is how a simple flexbox model looks like. Once we say display flex to a parent element, it automatically becomes `flex container` and the children inside it becomes `flex-item`.

### Terminology:

While working with flexbox model, there are few basic terminologies that you need to keep in mind. For example `flex container and flex-item`, as I have used just a few lines above. I will explain all the terminologies as it comes in our flow.

For now, let's see what is `flex container and flex-item`?

#### 1. Flex Container

The Parent element where you need to apply 'display: flex'.

#### 2. Flex Items

The children elements inside the flex container.

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AltCampus/flexbox/master/media/container-item.png)

If you remember in the beginning we talked that the flexbox model comes with some sets of properties and values, in which few belongs to parent container and few can be applied to the children items. So here we have few properties that can be applied to the 'flex container' and few can be applied to 'flex-item'. Let's see what are properties that can be applied to flex container, we will discuss them in detail and then after will move into the properties of flex-item.

## 3. Understanding the Flex Container properties.

According to the flexbox model, the properties that can be applied to flex containers are:

`Display, flex-direction, flex-wrap, flex-flow, justify-content, align-items, align-content`.

### A. Display:

The display property is to activate the flexbox model zone as we have discussed in the above section. Remember I told you that without setting the `display: flex`, you cannot get into the flexbox model zone, and therefore you cannot be benefited with the flexbox properties and values. This is the property from where the real magics get started.

The display property can take two values:

```
display: flex || inline-flex;
```

The `display: flex` works normally as we have seen earlier.

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AltCampus/flexbox/master/media/intro.png)

The `display: inline-flex` is similar to inline elements, but this is for the inline version of the flex container so that the container takes the space according to the content in it.

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AltCampus/flexbox/master/media/inline-flex.png)

### B. Flex Direction

Flex direction property determines the direction of the item in which they will lay down. By default when we set the property as `display: flex`, all the item lay down one by one horizontally. Technically saying "horizontally" will be wrong here in the flexbox model. Instead, I must say items lay down on the `main-axis`. Now here is the time to discuss the two other terminologies i.e. `main-axis and cross-axis`.

#### Terminology(main-axis and cross-axis)

Actually, in the flexbox model, there are two axes: `main-axis and cross-axis`. Here we don't have something like `horizontal-axis and vertical-axis`.

##### 1. Main Axis

The `main-axis` in the flexbox model is the primary axis along which the items are laid out in the flex container. By default, the `main-axis` feels like "horizontal direction", from left to right.

##### 2. Cross Axis

The `cross-axis` goes perpendicular to the `main-axis`. It feels like "vertical direction", top to bottom.

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AltCampus/flexbox/master/media/axis.png)

The important point to note here is that the `main-axis` is not necessary to remail always in the horizontal direction. We can anytime interchange the direction of axes with the `flex-direction` property. Now let's get back to the `flex-direction` property.

The flex-direction property can accept four values:

```
flex-direction: row || column || row-reverse || column-reverse;
```

#### Row(default)

```
flex-direction: row;
```

This is the default value for `flex-direction` property. After applying this property you won't find any changes.

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AltCampus/flexbox/master/media/row.png)

#### Column

```
flex-direction: column;
```

After this value, all the item in the flex-container will lay down top to bottom. This value changes the direction of the axes in the flexbox model. The `main-axis` takes the place of `cross-axis` and the `cross-axis` takes the place of `main-axis`.

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AltCampus/flexbox/master/media/column.png)

#### Row-reverse

```
flex-direction: row-reverse;
```

The `row-reverse` is similar to `row` but this all the item will sit from right to left means in the opposite direction.

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AltCampus/flexbox/master/media/row-reverse.png)

#### Column-reverse

```
flex-direction: column-reverse;
```

The `column-reverse` is also opposite to the `column`. The item will lay down from bottom to top.

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AltCampus/flexbox/master/media/column-reverse.png)

### B. Flex Wrap

Flex wrap is the property which determines how the flex-container will accommodate if there are few extra number flex-items inside it. This property is better to explain with examples.

Let's take a few more items inside the flex container.

```
  <div class="container">
    <div class="item">1</div>
    <div class="item">2</div>
    <div class="item">3</div>
    <div class="item">4</div>
    <div class="item">5</div>
    <div class="item">6</div>
    <div class="item">7</div>
    <div class="item">8</div>
    <div class="item">9</div>
  </div>

  * {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
  }
  .container {
    display: flex;
    background: #FAFFFC;
    border: 5px solid #182945;
  }
  .item {
    background: #9EDDEB;
    padding: 40px 50px;
    font-size: 34px;
    margin: 10px;
  }

```

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AltCampus/flexbox/master/media/flex-nowrap.png)

Yes! exactly this is what happens with the flexbox model if we add extra items in the container. This is the default behavior of the flexbox container. The flex-container will always accommodate all the new items in a single line, even although the browser needs to be scrolled horizontally. Because right now the items are not being wrapped inside the container.

For wrapping the items inside the flex container we have the `flex-wrap` property. The `flex-wrap` property comes with three different values:

```
flex-wrap: nowrap || wrap || wrap-reverse;
```

#### No wrap(default)

```
flex-wrap: nowrap;
```

The nowrap value is the default value, that we have seen earlier in this section. By default, the container has the `nowrap` value for `flex-wrap` property, whether we apply or not. The container will always accommodate all the items inside it in a single line.

#### Wrap

```
flex-wrap: wrap;
```

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AltCampus/flexbox/master/media/flex-wrap.png)

If the container does not has enough space to accommodate enough items in a single line, then with this value, the items will automatically break unto new lines.

#### Wrap Reverse

```
flex-wrap: wrap-reverse;
```

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AltCampus/flexbox/master/media/wrap-reverse.png)

The `wrap-reverse` is similar to `wrap` value, but this value wraps the items in reverse direction.

### C. Flex flow

Flex flow property is the shorthand property for `flex-direction and flex-wrap`. I hope we all know what are shorthand and longhand properties.

```
flex-flow: row wrap;
```

The `flex-flow` property accepts two value at a time, where the first value is for the `flex-direction` and the last value is for `flex-wrap`.

### D. Justify Content

To make the flexbox method more flexible the `justify-content` property plays an important role. This property defines how the items will be laid out on the "main-axis". It controls the alignment of the items on the "main-axis" also helps to make use extra space leftover in a flex container.

The `justify-content` property can take 6 different values:

```
justify-content: flex-start || flex-end || center || space-between || space-around || space-evenly;
```

#### Flex Start(default)

```

justify-content: flex-start;

```

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AltCampus/flexbox/master/media/intro.png)

This is the default value of `justify-content` property where all the flex-items will start from the starting point on the "main-axis". As we are seeing from the beginning only how the flex-items are being laid out from the starting point in a flex-container.

#### Flex End

```

justify-content: flex-end;

```

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AltCampus/flexbox/master/media/flex-end.png)

Here all the flex-items are laid out towards the endpoint of the "main-axis".

#### Center

```
justify-content: center;
```

The 'center' value for 'justify-content' will center the flex-items along the "main-axis" line.

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AltCampus/flexbox/master/media/center.png)

#### Space Between

```
justify-content: space-between;
```

The extra space in the flex container will be evenly distributed between the flex-items, where the first item in the container will stick to the starting point of the "main-axis" and the last item will stick to the endpoint of the main-axis.

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AltCampus/flexbox/master/media/space-between.png)

#### Space Around

```
justify-content: space-around;
```

The extra space in the flex container will be evenly distributed around the flex-items on the "main-axis". Means on the left side as well as on the right side of the flex-items there will equal amount of space.

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AltCampus/flexbox/master/media/space-around.png)

#### Space Evenly

```
justify-content: space-evenly;
```

The extra space in the flex container will be distributed in such a way that, the space between any two items as well the space of the item from the edge of the container will be equal.

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AltCampus/flexbox/master/media/space-evenly.png)

### D. Align Items

The `align-items` property is similar to `justify-content` property. The only difference is that the `align-items` property works on "cross-axis". It defines how the "flex-items" will be laid out on the "cross-axis" inside a "flex container".

The `align-items` property comes with four values:

```
align-items: stretch || flex-start|| flex-end|| center || baseline;
```

#### Stretch(default)

The stretch value for the `align-items` property is the default value. All the "flex-items" are stretched on the "cross-axis" to fill the extra space inside a container. By default, you won't see any effect on the items, because right now there is no extra space on the "cross-axis" inside the container. Just provide some height(let's say 350px) to the container and thereafter you can see the changes.

```
  .container {
  	display: flex;
  	background: #FAFFFC;
  	border: 5px solid #182945;
  	height: 350px;
  }
```

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AltCampus/flexbox/master/media/stretch.png)

That's how all the flex-items behaves in the flexbox method on "cross-axis". So without applying `align-items: stretch`, to the container the items are stretched out to fill the space on the "cross-axis".

#### Flex start

```
	.container {
		display: flex;
		background: #FAFFFC;
		border: 5px solid #182945;
		height: 350px;
		align-items: flex-start;
	}
```

As expected the `flex-items` will be laid out from the starting point on the "cross-axis".

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AltCampus/flexbox/master/media/align-start.png)

#### Flex End

```
  .container {
    display: flex;
    background: #FAFFFC;
    border: 5px solid #182945;
    height: 350px;
    align-items: flex-end;
  }
```

As expected the flex-items will be laid out towards the endpoint on the "cross-axis".

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AltCampus/flexbox/master/media/align-end.png)

#### Center

```
  .container {
    display: flex;
    background: #FAFFFC;
    border: 5px solid #182945;
    height: 350px;
    align-items: center;
  }
```

The `center` value for `align-items` property will center the flex-items along the "cross-axis" line.

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AltCampus/flexbox/master/media/align-center.png)

#### Baseline

```
  <div class="container">
    <div class="item item1">1</div>
    <div class="item item2">2</div>
    <div class="item item3">3</div>
    <div class="item item4">4</div>
  </div>

  .container {
    display: flex;
    background: #FAFFFC;
    border: 5px solid #182945;
    height: 350px;
  }
  .item {
    background: #9EDDEB;
    padding: 40px 50px;
    margin: 10px;
  }
  .item1 {
    font-size: 34px;
  }
  .item2 {
    font-size: 20px;
  }
  .item3 {
    font-size: 48px;
  }
  .item4 {
    font-size: 72px;
  }
```

Here the items are aligned based on the baseline of text inside the items.

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AltCampus/flexbox/master/media/baseline.png)

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AltCampus/flexbox/master/media/note1.png)

### D. Align Content

We have already seen `justify-content and align-items` property. The `justify-content` works on the "main-axis" and `align-items` works on the "cross-axis". But, here again, I am discussing the same thing, why? it's just because, the `align-content` property is somewhat similar to both `justify-content and align-items` property.

The difference is that the `justify-content and align-items` property works on the individual items but the `align-content` property works on the multi-line flex container. If all the "flex-items" are on a single line in a container then this property does not affect. And as we all know from the above discussion that the `justify` woks on "main-axis" and `align` works on the "cross-axis", therefore the `align-content` property will also work on the "cross-axis".

The `align-content` property accepts 6 different values:

```

align-content: stretch || flex-start || flex-end || center || space-between || space-around;

```

Let's experiment each value one by one but before that, we need to add a few more flex-items so that we have multi-line flex-container. Remember this property does not affect single line flex-container.

```

  <div class="container">
    <div class="item">1</div>
    <div class="item">2</div>
    <div class="item">3</div>
    <div class="item">4</div>
    <div class="item">5</div>
    <div class="item">6</div>
    <div class="item">7</div>
    <div class="item">8</div>
    <div class="item">9</div>
  </div>

  .container {
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    background: #FAFFFC;
    border: 5px solid #182945;
    height: 350px;
  }
  .item {
    background: #9EDDEB;
    padding: 40px 50px;
    margin: 10px;
  }

```

#### Stretch(default)

```

  .container {
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    align-content: stretch;
  }

```

This is the default value for the `align-content` property. All the items are stretched to take up the remaining space on the "cross-axis".

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AltCampus/flexbox/master/media/content-stretch.png)

#### Flex Start

```
  .container {
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    align-content: flex-start;
  }

```

All the items in a multi-line flex container will be aligned from the starting point on the "cross-axis".

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AltCampus/flexbox/master/media/content-start.png)

#### Flex End

```
  .container {
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    align-content: flex-end;
  }

```

All the items in a multi-line flex-container will be aligned towards the endpoint on the "cross-axis".

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AltCampus/flexbox/master/media/content-end.png)

#### Center

```
  .container {
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    align-content: center;
  }
```

Items are laid out to the center of the multi-line flex-container on the "cross-axis".

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AltCampus/flexbox/master/media/content-center.png)

#### Space Between

```

  .container {
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    align-content: space-between;
  }
```

The spaces are evenly distributed between the flex-items on the "cross-axis" as `justify-content: space-between` property works on the "main-axis".

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AltCampus/flexbox/master/media/content-between.png)

#### Space Around

```
  .container {
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    align-content: space-around;
  }
```

The spaces are evenly distributed around the flex-items on the "cross-axis" as `justify-content: space-around` property works on the "main-axis".

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AltCampus/flexbox/master/media/content-around.png)

## 4. Understanding the Flex Item properties.

In the last section, we have seen all the properties and values for the flex-container. We saw how we can align the items on "main-axis" or "cross-axis" and how to utilize the extra space inside a flex-container. Like flex-container, there are few properties for flex-items also in flexbox method. The properties that can be applied to flex-items are:

`order, flex-grow, flex-shrink, flex-basis, align-self`

### A. Order

This property allows us to reorder the flex-item within a flex-container without changing the source code in an HTML document. By default, we know that the elements are laid out according to the order in which it is written in the HTML document.

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AltCampus/flexbox/master/media/order.png)

This is how the elements come in a page according to the HTML source code and we are seeing from the very beginning only. However, we can reorder the place of items on a page with `order` property in flexbox method. For example, let's say we want our first item at the end.

```
  <div class="container">
    <div class="item item1">1</div>
    <div class="item item2">2</div>
    <div class="item item3">3</div>
    <div class="item item4">4</div>
  </div>

  .container {
    display: flex;
  }
  .item {
    background: #9EDDEB;
    padding: 40px 50px;
    margin: 10px;
  }
  .item1 {
    order: 1;
  }
```

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AltCampus/flexbox/master/media/order1.png)

The item-1 came at the last, just because its order 1. By default every item has '0' value for the order property and it may take either postive or negative value. Thereafter the items are reordered according to the values for the order property, from lowest to highest. If the order value for the items are same then the items are laid out according to the order appeared in HTML source code.

Let's see another example where we will reorder the 4th item at the first position and 1st item at the last.

```
  <div class="container">
    <div class="item item1">1</div>
    <div class="item item2">2</div>
    <div class="item item3">3</div>
    <div class="item item4">4</div>
  </div>

  .container {
    display: flex;
  }
  .item {
    background: #9EDDEB;
    padding: 40px 50px;
    margin: 10px;
  }
  .item1 {
    order: 1;
  }
  .item4 {
    order: -1;
  }
```

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AltCampus/flexbox/master/media/order2.png)

### A. Flex Grow

The `flex-grow` property allows the items to grow if there is extra space inside the flex container. The property accepts unitless value in number which provides the ability to grow to the items.

By default, the value for `flex-grow` property is 0, means the size of the item will be auto. It may accept any value but not in negative. If we want the item to grow and fill the extra space inside the container, will have to apply `flex-grow` property and set the value greater than 0. Let's check out the property visually.

Suppose we have two items inside a flex-container and we want the items to grow in same proportionality. Then we can set the value 1 for flex-grow property for the items.

```
  <div class="container">
    <div class="item item1">1</div>
    <div class="item item2">2</div>
  </div>

  .container {
    display: flex;
  }
  .item {
		background: #9EDDEB;padding: 40px 50px;
		margin: 10px;
		flex-grow: 1;
  }
```

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AltCampus/flexbox/master/media/flex-grow1.png)

Here, the items are growing in the same proportionality means the extra space inside the container is distributed to the items in equal amounts.

But, suppose if we want the first item to grow with proportionality 2, means the first item should get extra space in double amount than the second item. Let's see how we can do that.

```
  <div class="container">
    <div class="item item1">1</div>
    <div class="item item2">2</div>
  </div>

  .container {
    display: flex;
  }
  .item {
    background: #9EDDEB;
    padding: 40px 50px;
    margin: 10px;
  }
  .item1 {
    flex-grow: 2;
  }
  .item2 {
    flex-grow: 1;
  }

```

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AltCampus/flexbox/master/media/flex-grow2.png)

### A. Flex Shrink

The `flex-shrink` property is opposite to the `flex-grow` property. It allows the items to shrink if there is no extra space in the container. For the practical view, just reduce the size of your screens. You will find the width of the items is also reducing as the size of screens is reducing.

By default, value for `flex-shrink` property is 1. Similar to `flex-grow` property the `flex-shrink` property also accepts a unitless value but greater than 0. Negative values are invalid.

```
  <div class="container">
    <div class="item item1">1</div>
    <div class="item item2">2</div>
  </div>

  .container {
    display: flex;
  }
  .item {
    background: #9EDDEB;
    padding: 40px 50px;
    margin: 10px;
    flex-basis: 300px;
    flex-shrink: 1;
  }
```

Here, 1 is the default value for `flex-shrink` property that we have applied, means the item size will reduce as per the size of the screens. For a better understanding of `flex-shrink` property, I have also applied `flex-basis` property. The `flex-basis` property is to set the initial size of the item before the item will grow or shrink in a flex-container according to the extra space, that we will see in the next section.

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AltCampus/flexbox/master/media/flex-shrink1.png)

This is what we will see after applying `flex-shrink: 1 and flex-basis: 300px`. Now if you will reduce the size of your screen, the items size will also reduce.

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AltCampus/flexbox/master/media/flex-shrink2.png)

However, if we set 0 value for the `flex-shrink` property the item size won't reduce as per the size of the screens. The item will overflow in the flex container.

```
  <div class="container">
    <div class="item item1">1</div>
    <div class="item item2">2</div>
  </div>

  .container {
    display: flex;
  }
  .item {
    background: #9EDDEB;
    padding: 40px 50px;
    margin: 10px;
    flex-basis: 300px;
    flex-shrink: 0;
  }

```

### D. Flex Basis

We got a bit introduction of `flex-basis` property in the last section. The `flex-basis` property is somewhat similar to the width property, as it accepts the values(in px, %, em, rem, etc.) similar to the width property.
The `flex-basis` property is applied to set a base width or size of the flex-item from where the item will grow or shrink if necessary.

By default, the value for `flex-basis` property is auto, means the base size of the item will be computed based on to the content inside it plus whatever the padding we will apply to the item.

```
  <div class="container">
    <div class="item item1">1</div>
    <div class="item item2">2</div>
  </div>

  .container {
    display: flex;
  }
  .item {
    background: #9EDDEB;
    padding: 40px 50px;
    margin: 10px;
	  flex-basis: 200px;
  }

```

### E. Flex

`Flex` property is the shorthand property for the `flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis`.

```
.item {
	flex: 0 1 auto;
}
```

This is the default value for the `flex` property where the first value is for `flex-grow`, second is for `flex-shrink` and the last value is for `flex-basis`. The last two value for `flex` property is optional. We can also do something like this:

```
.item {
  flex: 1;
}
```

Here, 1 is the value for `flex-grow` property and the values for `flex-shrink and flex-basis` will be automatically set to the default.

It's better to go with with the `flex` shorthand property, instead of applying `flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis` individually.
