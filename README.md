## Introuduction

I hope we all have the basic knowledge of HTML and CSS now. In the last few days, we have learned how to position an element in a page according to the layout. We have learned about the floats and inline-block as well as a few advanced properties to position the elements. I am sure about the pain you guys might have been through while working with the floats and a few other properties of positioning. Because I also have been the same problem as you guys are facing now.
